[3/4/25 WG Chapter Session]{.underline}

XIP 11 Discussion

- Hoping to wrap up the edits on this soon

- We may want to change/add wherever the document says "per epoch" we
  add some sort of language like (14 days) to add clarity

  - **Assigned to Warshauer**

- When we meet on Friday, do we want to have this ready to say this
  version is what we're going to propose to the community?

  - General concensus is that the general framework is good to go

  - Confirmed that Rich is keen to get the framework out there ASAP

- Brought up the potential affect of XIP 11 and the onboarding of MSPs
  will want to either have contracts for USD or quickly liquidate their
  tokens. Do we add some sort of staking incentive or requirement to
  prevent that kind of gaming?

  - Helium only gets POC if the deployers buy their overpriced hardware

- In the future OpCo wants some sort of pricing tier model when the
  rewards are more closely tied to the economic value of the data being
  offloaded

  - For now, the data transfer bucket funding the emission rewards makes
    the most sense

  - May want to increase the margin on XNET-sold hardware to ensure that
    the margins also cover the support, fulfillment, COGs, etc.

- For now, the idea is POC is only for physical hardware

Warshauer to ask a couple clarification questions of Donal for the token
emissions schedule.
