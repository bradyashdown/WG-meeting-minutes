**Working Group Weekly Call 3/14/25**

Discussion around getting XIP 11 onto the new governance voting site and
ensuring that the WG Council has their wallet addresses onto the site.

Max brought up a Staking Solution using Streamflow API

- Stake durations: anticipate 3mo, 6mo, and 12mos.

- The longer the stake the more the rewards

Discussion on whether the 3, 6, and 12 months staking duration is
correct

Mad confirmed that we should be able to get the XIP 11 posted for final
voting

Timeline for implementation of XIP 11 to begin at start of Epoch 62. Mar
31, 2025 specifically. So the week of April 14,15,16 will be the payout
according to the new XIP 11 protocols.

Brady and Mad are to create a Repo for XIPS under Vote so that we can
vote and not just on a random google doc

Discussion around POC qualification

- Likely need to do some sort of culing in the next two weeks to remove
  devices that are obviously dead on network

- Discussion about needing to remove residential

- Discussion about likely don't give POC for brownfield devices

- Add a footnote about what "online" means -- at least a kilobyte of
  data
